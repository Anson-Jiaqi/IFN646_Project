# IFN646 Project

This repository contains the code and data needed for the IFN646 project.

## Task 1

In this task, we will perform differential expression analysis using **DESeq2** and **edgeR**. All necessary data is provided in the `Data` folder:

- `count.txt`: Contains count data for analysis.
- `meta.txt`: Contains metadata corresponding to the count data.

### Instructions

1. Install necessary R packages (`DESeq2`, `edgeR`).
2. Load the data from `count.txt` and `meta.txt`.
3. Follow the script provided in the code for DESeq2 and edgeR analysis.

## Task 2

In this task, we will use **FlashFry**, a tool for genome-wide guide RNA (gRNA) design. FlashFry can be downloaded from the following link:

- [FlashFry GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mckennalab/FlashFry?tab=readme-ov-file)

### Commands

The commands to run FlashFry are provided in the `command.txt` file in this repository. Please refer to this file to execute the necessary steps for gene data processing.

For additional guidance, please refer to the [official FlashFry documentation](https://github.com/mckennalab/FlashFry).

### Gene Data

The required gene data for this task can be downloaded from the following link:

## Task 3

The code for Task 3 is contained in the Jupyter notebook file `task3.ipynb`. Please download and use this file to carry out the analysis.

### Instructions

1. Download the `task3.ipynb` file from this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries as per the notebookâ€™s instructions.
3. Execute the notebook step-by-step to perform the analysis.

### Data

The data for Task 3 can also be downloaded from the same Kaggle dataset used in Task 2:
